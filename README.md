# PowerShell Playground
A repository dedicated to my PowerShell scripting adventures, where I explore and experiment with different PowerShell projects and concepts. This folder serves as a sandbox for my PowerShell learning, allowing me to tinker with PowerShell code, try out new ideas, and learn PowerShell scripting techniques. From small scripts to more complex automation tasks, this GitHub folder is my playground for honing my PowerShell skills, automating tasks, and mastering PowerShell scripting.
